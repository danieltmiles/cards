## Programming exercise as given:
> Using Python, please write a set of classes that represent a deck of cards. Classes like "card" and "deck" might be appropriate- but it's entirely up to you. You should be able to "shuffle" the deck. You should also be able to draw cards from the deck one at a time until the deck is empty. Unit tests are required, and the code should be usable from other code. If you want to include a user interface, that's fine, but it's not required.

The solution is broken into two main modules. One for tests, and the other for card operations. They are labeled respectively, "cards," and, "tests."
